This method fully runs locally using FAISS for vector search and sentence-transformers for text embeddings. No external API calls (e.g., OpenAI) are needed.

Key Components
Text Embedding Model

Uses sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to convert text into vector embeddings.
FAISS Vector Store

A flat L2 index (IndexFlatL2) is created to store and search for embeddings.
This index enables fast similarity search.
Core Functions

process_input(): Handles CLI input.
embed_text(text): Converts text into an embedding.
add_to_db(text): Converts text to an embedding and stores it in FAISS.
search_db(query, top_k=3): Searches for the most similar stored embeddings in FAISS.
How It Works
User provides input text.
Embedding is generated using sentence-transformers.
Text embedding is stored in FAISS (add_to_db).
User queries the system, and FAISS searches for the most similar stored text (search_db).
Pros & Cons
✅ Fully local (No API calls, No internet required).
✅ Cost-free (No OpenAI API costs).
✅ Fast (FAISS optimizes nearest neighbor search).

⚠️ Embedding quality is lower compared to OpenAI’s models.
⚠️ Limited to pre-trained transformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2).
⚠️ No text generation (Unlike OpenAI’s completion models).

When to Use This?
If you want full privacy and zero API costs.
If you only need fast similarity search and not AI-generated responses.
If you plan to scale locally without cloud dependencies.


i am updating this project to use both local and openai embeddings
